# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
PyBer a ride-sharing app company has hired V.Isualize to analyze rideshare data between January and early May of 2019 to help improve accessability and affordability for under-served neighborhoods. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the relationships between type of city and number of drivers, number of riders and fares. 

## Results

### Ride-Sharing Summary by City Type
The first part of the analysis created a summary of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per drivers as shown in the table below.

- Urban Cities
    - The highest total rides, drivers and fares, with a higher number of drivers than rides. 
    - The lowest average fare per ride and per driver, with lower average fares for drivers than riders.
- Suburban Cities
    - Lower total rides, drivers and fare than Urban cities, with less drivers than rides. 
    - Slightly higher average fare per ride and signficantly higher average fare per driver than Urban Cities, with higher average fares for drivers than riders. 
- Rural Cities
    - The lowest total rides, drivers and fares, with less drivers than rides. 
    - Highest average fare per ride and per driver, with much higher average fares for drivers than riders.
- The results indicate that:
    - A more populated city has more drivers available which is resulting in lower fares
    - A less populated city has less available drivers which is resulting in higher fares. 

### Total Fares by City Type
The second part of the analysis created a line chart that shows total fares by week for each  city type from January 1, 2019 to April 28, 2019 as shown in the figure below.

- Urban Cities
    - The highest total fares is during late February and early March.
    - The lowest total fares is during early January and early April. 
- Suburban Cities
    - The highest total fares is during late February and late April. 
    - The lowest total fares is during early January and mid-April.
- Rural Cities
    - The highest total fares is during late February and early April.
    - The lowest total fares is during mid-January and mid-February.

## Summary 
The analysis results have shown that there are disparities among the different city types. To help address these disparities, the recommendations are:
- Rural cities and Suburban cities experienced higher average fare per ride and driver than Urban Cities so increased incentives for drivers can help increase the number of drivers to improve affordability and accessibility for riders. 
- Urban cities have the highest number of drivers, but lower rides, so promotion of the app to potential riders can help increase the average fare per driver.  
- Rural cities experienced the highest total fares in early April, so more discounts during that time period can help improve affordability.
